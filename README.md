## An introduction to Python for neuroscience-inclined Matlab users
This notebook was used for a tutorial given to grad students in systems neuroscience to introduce some basics of Google Colab and Python. The pre-course assignment was to watch this introduction to programming in neuroscience by Pascal Wallisch at SfN18 ([link]( https://neuronline.sfn.org/career-paths/teaching-computation-in-neuroscience) scroll to video 3 of 7) and this introductory video from Google Colab ([link]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI))
